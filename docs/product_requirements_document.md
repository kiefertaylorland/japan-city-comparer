## ✅ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1. Problem Statement
Travelers often struggle to choose which Japanese city best suits their interests and budget. They need a visual, simple way to compare.

### 2. Goals and Objectives
- Enable users to **compare Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto** across relevant travel dimensions.
- Present **clean, digestible visuals** for quick understanding
- Provide **city detail pages** for further exploration

### 3. Success Criteria (MVP)
- Users can:
  - See a table comparing all 3 cities
  - View bar charts or icons for each comparison category
  - Navigate to each city’s overview

### 4. Non-Goals
- Real-time pricing data
- Booking or itinerary creation
- User authentication

### 5. Timeline (Estimated)
- Week 1: Project setup, component wireframes
- Week 2: Build comparison table + charts
- Week 3: Add city detail pages, responsive styling
- Week 4: Polish UI, deploy to Netlify/Vercel

### 6. Risks & Mitigations
- **Too much data:** Limit scope to ~6 categories
- **Overcomplex UI:** Favor simplicity over feature creep

### 7. Future Considerations
- Add more cities (e.g., Sapporo, Fukuoka)
- Enable user-generated rankings
- Local language toggle (EN/JP)
